AI Search Engine

a smart AI search engine that actually understands your stuff - docs, audio, photos, videos. Runs completely offline on your machine, so no sketchy cloud uploads or internet required.

Quick Start

```bash
# Get the code
git clone [repository]

# Start the web version
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Or run the desktop app
cd frontend && npm run tauri
```

How to Use

1. Hit up **Settings** to index whatever folders you want
2. Search for literally anything - describe what you're looking for, mention what's in the file, whatever comes to mind
3. It'll find it

That's it. No complicated setup, no accounts, just search your files the way you'd describe them to a friend.
